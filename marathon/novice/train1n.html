<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#006600"><B>Monday:</B></FONT> In this training 
  schedule for novice marathoners, Monday is <I>always </I>a day of rest. <B>Count 
  on it!</B> Rest is important for recovery after the weekend's workouts, particularly 
  as the long runs progress from 6 to 20 miles. Your body needs time to recover. 
  So take the day off. Friday is also a day of rest. In this program you will 
  run on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Sunday is a day for cross-training. 
  (If you want, you can reverse the order of the Saturday/Sunday workouts.) Let's 
  begin this Monday, the first day of your marathon journey, by contemplating 
  the training that will begin tomorrow. 
  <P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#006600"><B>Tuesday:</B></FONT> An easy day. Run 3 
    miles at a comfortable pace. Over the next 18 weeks, you will add only a few 
    miles to your Tuesday workouts. In Week 1, you'll move up to 4 miles. In week 
    14, you'll be up to 5 miles. By that time, you'll be so used to doing much 
    longer runs on Wednesdays and Saturdays, that a run of that distance will 
    seem easy. It's all part of the progressive buildup of total mileage designed 
    to get you ready to run 26 miles. If even running 3 miles seems a strain for 
    you, don't hesitate to mix in a walking break.</P>
   
   
  <P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#006600"><B>Wednesday:</B></FONT> Three miles, same 
    as yesterday. As the countdown continues, you will begin to run more miles 
    midweek. Every second week (beginning in Week 3), you will add another mile 
    to your Wednesday workout. By Week 15 (the same week in which you do your 
    climactic 20-miler), you will be up to 10 miles this day. This midweek workout 
    is what I call a "sorta long"&nbsp;run. What you will find most difficult 
    as the mileage progresses from 3 to 10 is not going the distance, but finding 
    time to squeeze a run taking more than an hour into a busy weekday. I'll offer 
    some tips on that when the time comes. In the meantime, have a good run today.</P>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#006600"><B>Thursday:</B></FONT> Run the
   same distance that you did on Tuesday: 3 miles at a comfortable
   pace. Again, remember the walking-break option I suggested for you
   on Tuesday. At 3 miles, you may want to run the full distance. But
   as the distance builds, and particularly on days when the weather
   is warm, you will appreciate a short break, particularly to stop
   for water. Since most novice runners will do some walking in the
   marathon--if only through the aid stations--you want to practice
   this as part of your strategy.</P>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#006600"><B>Friday:</B></FONT> Friday in
   almost all of my training programs for different distances is a
   day of rest, to allow you to gather strength for the weekend. I
   ask even the Advanced runners to rest on Friday--although, being
   compulsive, not all of them listen to my advice! (Don't tell them
   I said that.) As a Novice runner, I&nbsp;know you won't hesitate
   to do <I>exactly</I> what I&nbsp;tell you. So take today off.</P>
   
   
  <P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#006600"><B>Saturday:</B></FONT> Today is your "long 
    run." Even for a novice or beginning runner, 6 miles (today's workout) may 
    not seem that long. But over the 18 weeks of this program, the distance for 
    your Saturday run will increase to 20 miles in Week 15 (allowing 3 weeks for 
    you to taper before the marathon.) Don't worry too much about pace now; just 
    run easily. If you want to do your long runs on Sunday rather than Saturday, 
    simply flip-flop the two workouts.</P>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#006600"><B>Sunday: </B></FONT>Use this
   second day of the weekend to recover from your weekly long run by
   doing some easy cross-training. What kind of
   cross-training?&nbsp;The exercise you choose should be aerobic: an
   hour or so of walking, biking, swimming or some such activity.
   Swimming is a particularly useful activity, because you can use it
   to loosen your muscles. If you run long Sundays, you can
   cross-train on Saturdays.</P>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FF0000"><B><U>Tip of the
   Week:</U></B></FONT><U> </U>With the marathon 18 weeks away, plan
   the training now that will permit you success. Marathon training
   works best if you start easy and build gradually: A long run of 6
   miles in June becomes 20 miles in September. Most important at
   this time is to establish a goal, whether that goal is to finish
   or to run fast. Once that goal is chosen, everything else will
   fall in place.</P>
