<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#006600"><B>Monday:</B></FONT>
   Monday is a day of rest. It doesn't seem like you need to rest
   after only a 6-miler over the weekend, but you will be thankful
   for your Monday rest days as the program continues. While taking
   the day off, evaluate how you felt after your first week of
   marathon training. For some of you, it may have been your first
   <I>serious</I> week of training as a runner. There's a difference
   between "training"&nbsp;and simply "running"&nbsp;or "jogging." A
   lot of people play at running, going out for an occasional run on
   weekends, if the weather is good. Sometimes they'll run three or
   four days in a row--then skip several weeks before running again.
   But that's not training. Training is when you follow a schedule,
   such as this one, where each day has a purpose. If the weather is
   bad, you still run. If you have important business, you simply
   rise an hour early to run. Why? Because I&nbsp;told you to! And if
   Hal tells you to rest, you rest. Pay attention, follow my
   directions, and I'll get you to the finish line 17 weeks from
   today. That's a promise!
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#006600"><B>Tuesday:</B></FONT> Today's
   workout is a run of 3 miles at a comfortable pace, the same as
   last week on Tuesday and the same as next week on Tuesday. This
   workout shouldn't take a great deal of your time: 30 minutes if
   you run at a 10:00-mile pace. <I>But forget I said that!</I> I
   don't want you to go out and time yourself for 3 miles. In fact,
   your course doesn't need to be precisely 3 miles. It can be
   <I>about</I> that distance. The easiest way to pick a course of 3
   miles would be to get in your car and figure out how far you need
   to run to go about half that distance (1.5 miles), either from
   your home, from your office or from wherever you plan to run on
   Tuesdays. Then run this 1.5-mile course out and back. Don't wear a
   watch, at least for the time being.</P>
   
   
  <P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#006600"><B>Wednesday:</B></FONT> Another 3-miler. 
    This is your "hard" day of the week. If you want to run a bit faster than 
    yesterday, do so. Today's 3-miler is also the same as last week's Tuesday 
    workout, but next week you move up to 4 miles. As the program continues, the 
    Wednesday mileage will increase 1 mile every second week until you reach a 
    peak of 10 miles on Wednesday in Week 4. It's all part of my Grand Plan to 
    get you in shape for the marathon. And trust me:&nbsp;You will succeed!&nbsp;</P>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#006600"><B>Thursday:</B></FONT> Still
   another 3-miler! It seems like we're in a rut, but don't worry:
   Next week the midweek workouts take a <I>slight </I>bump upwards
   in distance. Most of the mileage changes from week to week in this
   program are "slight." Slight changes will gradually get you in
   shape--and that's the best way. Slight changes will do it, but for
   the time being, be content with your third 3-miler in 3 days. The
   simplest and easiest way to accomplish a 3-mile workout is to run
   the same measured course each time. But consider having separate
   Tuesday and Thursday courses. Particularly as the program
   continues, you may want to bring some variety to your
   workouts.</P>
   
   
  <P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#006600"><B>Friday:</B></FONT> This is a day of rest. 
    Seemingly, you don't need a rest day now, but wait until your weekend runs 
    start getting longer. I've been focusing on course measurement in some of 
    my comments this week. You might even call this the "Theme for Week 2." So 
    if you're looking for something to do with your extra time while not running 
    today, jump in the car and go out and measure a series of courses from 3 miles 
    up. You'll use them during the remaining weeks of this Marathon Training Program.</P>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#006600"><B>Saturday:</B></FONT> Run 7
   miles. In your second week, you now have gone from 6 to 7 miles
   for your long run. This doesn't seem like much of a jump, but
   steady increases in distance will help prepare you for the stress
   of running 26 miles. Don't worry too much about how fast you run
   in these early weeks. Just run at a pace that will allow you to
   cover the 7-mile distance easily. Feel free to take some walking
   breaks in the middle of your run. And remind
   yourself:&nbsp;<I>You're doing great!</I> Today you've finished
   your second week of marathon training.</P>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#006600"><B>Sunday:</B></FONT> Take an
   hour and go for a walk, or bike ride, or do some swimming. This is
   your cross-training day, and it's here for two purposes. One, you
   want to train for about an hour to improve your aerobic base. Two,
   you want to exercise differently to both loosen your running
   muscles and allow them to recover. Don't underestimate the value
   of this second weekend workout. It's important!</P>
   
   <P>&nbsp;</P>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FF0000"><B><U>Tip of the
   Week:</U></B></FONT> Easy days are as important in your training
   plan as hard days. You won't get the full benefits of the
   progressive long-run buildup on the weekends, unless you rest
   before and after. Resting on Fridays and Mondays allows you to run
   harder on Saturdays and Sundays, when you will have more time to
   spend on your workouts. The marathon is 17 weeks away, but your
   success depends on the steady base that you are building now.</P>
